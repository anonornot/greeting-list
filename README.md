## **SillyTavern Greeting List Extension**


## Installation

Download and move this file into SillyTavern's `~\SillyTavern\data\default-user\extensions` directory.

Or just download it through extensions tab.

## Requirements

[LaLib Extension](https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-LALib)

## What does it do

Populates the dropdown list with loaded swipes, so it's technically a swipe list, but I'm too lazy to change the name and everything so let's call it greeting list.
